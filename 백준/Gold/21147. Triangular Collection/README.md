### 문제 설명

<p>Call a set of positive integers <em>triangular</em> if it has size at least three and, for all triples of distinct integers from the set, a triangle with those three integers as side lengths can be constructed.</p>

<p>Given a set of positive integers, compute the number of its <em>triangular</em> subsets.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$), which is the number of integers in the set.</p>

<p>Each of the the next $n$ lines contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^9$). These are the elements of the set. They are guaranteed to be distinct.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output a single integer, which is the number of triangular subsets of the given set.</p>
